        <h1>File an application</h1>
        <p>Once you have prepared the required information and documents, you can proceed to fill in your registration application.</p>
        <h2>Access the registration application</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/AccessSnippet.flsnp" />
        <h2>Fill in the registration application</h2>
        <p>The detailed guide on how to fill in individual fields is available in section <a href="../Express path/Fill in form.htm" target="_blank">How to fill in the form</a><a href="../Express path/Fill in form.htm">.</a></p>
        <h2>File your registration application</h2>
        <p>If you have completed the registration application on-line, just click "ZŁÓŻ"&#160;(Submit) button.</p>
        <p>If you have completed the registration application on paper, you can file it:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>by post - you can send it to any community office. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you choose this method, you must sign your registration application in the presence of a notary, who will confirm authenticity of your signature.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in person - you can deliver it to any community office in Poland, regardless of where you live. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will need to present to an officer the original document (or its notarised copy) confirming your status of a foreigner. It can be any of the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>
                <p>if you are married to a Polish citizen - your marriage certificate and a document confirming your spouse's identity,</p>
            </li>
            <li>a Polish card,</li>
            <li>
                <p>a permit for a temporary stay in Poland</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The officer will scan the document and attach it to your registration application.&#160;This will accelerate processing your application.</p>
        <h2>What next</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Once you filed your registration application, the process is over. This is what will happen next:</p>
        <ol>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">The office will verify your application. If there are any errors in your application filed online, you will be informed by an automated message. If you filed your application in person or by post, the office will contact you and ask you to correct any errors or omissions. You will have 7 business days to do it.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">If your application was correct, your business will be entered in CEIDG.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">The entry will be visible on the next business day following the date when your application was filed. </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">You can start your business on the same day when you filed your registration application.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">CEIDG will forward your data to the relevant tax office. The office will assign you a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term15">NIP</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;number, if you do not have it yet. </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">CEIDG&#160;will forward your data to <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term14">Statistics Poland</MadCap:glossaryTerm> (GUS). You will be assigned a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term12">REGON</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;number. </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">CEIDG&#160;will forward your data to the Social Security Office (ZUS).</li>
