        <h1>Business address</h1>
        <div class="AFRNUTSHELL">
            <p style="text-align: justify;" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;In a nutshell:&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">You can, but do not have to, indicate a business address. You must provide a correspondence address, though.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You can  run your business from one or more places, for example, an office, a service point, a virtual office, a co-working space, from your own home, or you can have no permanent address, for example if you provide services at clients’ homes.</p>
        <p>Your choice of your place of business should be made at registration. Generally, you have three options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"no permanent place of business" – if you do not have a permanent address for your business</li>
            <li>	one permanent place of business</li>
            <li>	more permanent places of business (branches)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="AFREMEMBER">
            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember:&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>If you want to register a permanent address for your business, you need to have a legal title to it.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Such legal title could be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ownership or co-ownership right to property</li>
            <li>perpetual usufruct of and the ownership right of buildings located on the land – this is most often the case where you own a plot of land</li>
            <li>cooperative right to premises</li>
            <li>a tenacy agreement</li>
            <li>a lease agreement</li>
            <li>a lending for use agreement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The legal title to the premises should be documented with one of the following documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>	a sale agreement in the form of a notarial deed</li>
            <li>an extract from land and mortgage register</li>
            <li>an ownership deed for land</li>
            <li>an administrative decision</li>
            <li>a written tenancy or lease agreement or an agreement for lending for use</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">You do not need to show any documents proving your title to the address or attach them to your application, but when you indicate a particular address in your application, you declare that you have the relevant legal title to the premises in question. The body responsible for keeping the CEIDG register (the relevant minister) can request you to present the relevant document. Then you will need to comply with the request within 7 days of request. If you fail to do it, your entry in CEIDG will be deleted.</p>

            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember:&lt;/b&gt;"> </p>
            <p>If you are planning to run your business activity in rented premises, you need to obtain the landlord’s consent.</p>

        <div class="AFREMEMBER">
            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember:&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>You are required to provide a correspondence address, that is, the address where all correspondence regarding your business activity will be sent. It can be the address of your permanent residence or any other address where you will collect correspondence.</p>
        </div>
