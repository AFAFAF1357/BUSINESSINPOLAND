        <h2>When a fiscal cash register is required</h2>
        <p>You will need to have a fiscal cash register, if you sell your goods or services to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>natural persons who do not run a business activity</li>
            <li>farmers that sell agricultural products produced by them, who are exempt from VAT</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <p>If you are required to use a fiscal cash register, you will be also required to have a payment card terminal, so that your clients can pay with a payment card.</p>
            <p>&#160;</p>
        </div>
        <p>When you are exempt from the obligation to have a fiscal cash register:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>when you sell specified types of goods or services</li>
            <li>when the value of your sales to natural persons and farmers referred to above did not exceed PLN 20,000 in the previous fiscal year.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="AFREMEMBER">
            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember:&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>This exemption does not apply, if you sell goods or services that are subject to registration requirement.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You are required to have a fiscal cash register, if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sell the following goods:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>liquid gas, motor parts, car bodies, tobacco products, alcoholic beverages, perfume and toilet water</p>
        <ul>
            <li>provide the following services:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>taxi services, repair of motors and motor bikes, tax advisory services, catering, including seasonal catering, hairdressing and barbering, beauty care and cosmetology</p>
        <p>The list provided is an example only.

        <div class="AFREMEMBER">
            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember:&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>If you are starting a business activity and expect that your sales to natural persons and farmers will not exceed PLN 20,000, you do not need to have a fiscal cash register. Once you exceed this limit, you will have two months before you become obliged to have a fiscal cash register.</p>
