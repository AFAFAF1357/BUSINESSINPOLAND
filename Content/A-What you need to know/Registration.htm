            <p>You do not need to register a small-size business activity generating insignificant revenue</p>
        </div>
        <h2>When registration is not required <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term5">(unregistered business activity</MadCap:glossaryTerm>)</h2>
        <p>If you plan a small-scale activity and expect to generate an insignificant income only, you can start your business without any formalities – you do not need to register your business.</p>
        <p>You can run an unregistered business activity, if you meet all of the following conditions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your revenue in a single month does not exceed <a name="limit"></a>50% of the minimum remuneration (in 2023, the minimum salary is PLN 3490  in the first half of the year – until 30 June, and PLN 3600 in the second half of the year, from 1 July). It means that you cannot earn more than PLN 1745 a month in the first half of the year, and more than PLN 1800 a&#160;month in the second half) . Current information on the average salary and the minimum salary is published by the <a href="https://www.zus.pl/baza-wiedzy/skladki-wskazniki-odsetki/wskazniki/minimalne-i-przecietne-wynagrodzenie" target="_blank">Social Security Office</a>.</li>
            <li>You are a natural person</li>
            <li>You do not operate a civil-law partnership</li>
            <li>You do not run a regulated activity, i.e., an activity that requires a permit or a licence</li>
            <li>You have not been conducting any business activity for the last 60 months.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="AFREMEMBER">
            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember:&lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>You do not need to register a business, if you plan to operate as a farmer and engage in </p>
            <ul>
                <li>offering accommodation to holidaymakers (agroturystyka)</li>
                <li>wine production</li>
                <li>retail trade in agricultural products.</li>

            <p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Remember: &lt;/b&gt;">&#160;</p>
            <p>You can run an unregistered business activity while working under an employment contract. This is a good and safe way to test your business in a safe environment, without quitting your permanent job.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited costs and formalities . You do not need to register your business with CEIDG, tax office or the Central Statistical Office – you do not need a NIP or REGON&#160;number.</li>
            <li>You do not pay social and health insurance contributions. If you operate under a mandate agreement (<i>umowa zlecenie</i>), your client will be responsible for paying any social insurance contributions.</li>
            <li>You do not need to pay monthly tax advances. Your yearly income will be included in your annual tax declaration PIT-36.</li>
            <li>You do not need to keep full accounting records. A simplified sales register will be sufficient.</li>
            <li>	As a result, an unregistered business activity is exempt from VAT, except for some types of activity that require a VAT status regardless of revenues. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>What are your duties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Record every product or service sold</li>
            <li>	Issue invoices or bills when a client requests them</li>
            <li>	Respect general consumer rights – right to withdraw from an agreement, to lodge a complaint, etc.</li>
        </ul>
