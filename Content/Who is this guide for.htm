            <p>This guide is for you, if you are staying in Poland and have been granted a right to a legal stay here. It includes citizens of EU and EEA member states, citizens of the US&#160;and Switzerland, and citizens of other countries, if they have a status mentioned in this chapter.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">If your legal situation is regulated and you have an idea for business, it might be a good idea to start your own business . The process of registering business activity is fairly simple.&#160;This guide contains the necessary information and will help you to complete the required form. Ideally, you should be able to complete the process on your own and without any knowledge of Polish. It may happen, though, that depending on the type of your business, you will need to consult some legal acts that are available in Polish only. In such a situation, ask your Polish-speaking friend. When the situation may have legal or financial implications, you may need to consult a lawyer or an accountant. This guide will tell you which part of which act you should consult, so you will only need a small piece of content translated.</p>
        <p class="printonlyheading">Good luck with your new business!&#160;</p>
        <p>You do not need to be a Polish citizen to start a business as a sole trader. The exact requirements depend on your country of origin. See the information in the table below.</p>
